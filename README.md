# GraphQL-Apollo-Project
Hello , Thank you fro visiting this project.
As name suggests that It is being made with apollo package for express to work with GraphQl
Now, here I have also uploaded the env file as it contains nothing serious so don't get 
any funny idea :P

#installation
just do as usual `npm i` after cloning the repo

#notes
1. I have only followed ESM methods to implement this as like other projects
2. it's only memory base project , no database included.

#Thank you and ciao :)
